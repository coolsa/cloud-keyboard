# Yet another preonic clone

This keyboard is designed using the excellent [*hotswappable keyboard generator*](https://github.com/50an6xy06r6n/hotswap_pcb_generator), the [*KeyV2* key cap generator](https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2), and the [*QMK* firmware](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware)


If I get far enough, this may come to use the [*ZMK* firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) for bluetooth support, using the NRF52 chip and a custom PCB, but thats far, *far* in the future.

## Why are you doing this?

I really want to build my own keyboard again, but this time have a better design. I have previously hand-soldered a keyboard, but it turned out as an overall disaster. The keyboard, a planck clone, was marred by bad soldering jobs, poor printer tollerances, and generally aweful colour choices.

This time, I come with more experience in both software *and* hardware, and the research I have done previously on the topic of keyboard design. Also, the preonic has more keys, a whole extra row, so thats more potential for activities there!

As a secondary goal, I also hope to gain experience in the realm of Stenography, using the [*wonderful software Plover*](https://github.com/openstenoproject/plover). With skills in that, I could potentially improve my typing skills beyond an average of 100 words per minute, and finally write that gosh darn book, am I right??????

## Whats the design?

There are two designs that I've been looking into, one is split while the other is a proper keyboard. The proper keyboard has some major hurdles, that being my printer is too small to print the ~26cm board. The split option is significantly more promissing, as then it is only a software side limitation. The hotswappable keyboard generator that is being was also designed for that case in mind. I may yet use a single keyboard, but a split is going to face less technical challenges.

# Where are you at?

Currently, I have the keycaps printing. I have the colour scheme picked out (Gold and Marble), and some rough experience with the hotswap pcb generator.

I still need to look into QMK, as I only have TRS plugs, not TRRS, but the QMK specs do say that they don't *need* both lines, so I could be ok there?

Then, theres the configuration alteration that can happen forever, but thats not a huge deal and there are lots of things I can base my layout off of. Just need to make sure there is a minecraft layer, so I can do things like F3+B.

# Whats the TODO?

- [x] Come up with design, work out rough idea.
- [x] Keycaps!
- [x] Finalize design of keyboard. (Here right now)
- [ ] Begin printing keyboard
- [ ] Keyboard assembly
- [ ] Keyboard programming
- [ ] Keyboard finished! Now forever config!
